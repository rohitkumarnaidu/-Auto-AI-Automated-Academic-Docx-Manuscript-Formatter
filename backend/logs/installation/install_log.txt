INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of langchain-community to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install langchain-community==0.3.18, langchain-core==0.3.35, langchain-text-splitters==0.3.6 and langchain==0.3.18 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested langchain-core==0.3.35
    langchain 0.3.18 depends on langchain-core<1.0.0 and >=0.3.34
    langchain-text-splitters 0.3.6 depends on langchain-core<1.0.0 and >=0.3.34
    langchain-community 0.3.18 depends on langchain-core<1.0.0 and >=0.3.37

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    langchain-core

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
