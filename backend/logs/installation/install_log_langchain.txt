INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of langchain-community to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.langchain.txt (line 3) and langchain==0.3.18 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested langchain==0.3.18
    langchain-community 0.3.18 depends on langchain<1.0.0 and >=0.3.19

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    langchain

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
